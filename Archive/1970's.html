            As a Black lesbian born in the US, the 1980s holds bittersweet memories. For I was witness to
            the spectacular success of queer singers such as Whitney Houston and Luther Vandross —
            despite their reluctance to claim what we all knew to be their truths — and a deadly AIDS
            epidemic that took the lives of powerful out, Black gay figures including filmmaker Marlon Riggs,
            fashion designer Willi Smith and the <span class="quotes">“You Make Me Feel Mighty Real”</span> queen of disco, Sylvester.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Sadly, Whitney and Luther also died unexpectedly from other causes.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Quiet as it’s been kept, there were also multitudes of Black women who contracted the virus in
          the 1980s and who struggled for visibility. Writer Imani Harrington comes immediately to mind.
          Her landmark collection of plays Positive/Negative: Women of Color and HIV/AIDS gave voice
          to a community that had been silenced.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col story-left">
          <p class="paragraph">
            I first met Imani (meaning <span class="quotes">“belief”</span> or <span class="quotes">“faith”</span> in Swahili) while soaking in a hot tub in San
          Francisco. I was impressed by the sense of calm that she exuded at a time when even a
          whisper of the word <span class="quotes">“AIDS”</span> terrified people. As far as I know, Imani remains well and is
          reportedly working on a play about Hurricane Katrina, AIDS and slavery. I was honoured to call
          her a friend and colleague.
          </p>
         <p class="paragraph">
          The 1980s also saw the publication of The Color Purple by the boldly non-binary author/activist
          Alice Walker. First the novel and later, the 1985 film adaptation, presented a loving romance
          between two Black women. So, I was thrilled when, in 2019, the Neptune Theatre in Halifax
          mounted a musical production of the work. I saw it six times!
